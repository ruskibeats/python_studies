Do you feel overwhelmed with the tight profit margins, ongoing staff issues or maybe outsourcing failed for you? Perhaps you aren't making enough profit and you want somebody to take it off your hands but you don’t want to sell up?

If this is you, you're on the right page!

We can manage your entire firm for you (whilst you retire!)

Who Am I?

I started my first accountancy practice in 2008 with only £10 in my pocket. In just a few years my practice was turning over £1M a year with zero debt, having qualified with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as one of their youngest Chartered Accountants in the Country.

I’ve spoken at national events including the BBC, QuickBooks, and am a motivational speaker at several universities. Interviews with me have appeared on various accounting networks such as AccountingWeb and Sage.

I have always been highly interested in technology, and consider myself more of a tech and business guy than an accountant. I have received hands-on training by some of the biggest names in marketing, which knowledge I have used to increase my companies' market share in the industry.

I run several businesses, all in some way related to accounting or consultancy. My accountancy practice has won multiple awards, including runner-up for QuickBooks's FIRM OF THE FUTURE AWARD due to our firm's efficiency and productivity in systems and controls.

My business, We Run Your Practice, has revolutionised ""Outsourcing"" for accountancy practices, offering a never-before-heard-of method of managing an accountancy firm's day-to-business where we take on all the workload and yet the practice keeps its clients and its profits.

I am on LinkedIn in order to connect with professionals who are serious about business. In a tight-margin industry such as accounting, which is highly regulated and closely monitored, I have learned that there are no substitutes in business for competence, effectiveness, and reliability.

I am a LinkedIn Open Networker. Anyone is welcome to connect with me. I look forward to meeting you and hopefully doing business together.

Why not get in touch today for a chat? I’d love to hear from you.

🟠 We help companies making more profit than the owners spend that want a tax efficient structure to create long term wealth.
🔵 We work with companies to avoid the significant trading risk of asset ownership with practical ownership strategies for wealth protection
🟢 We specialise in digging in deep to help business owners like you avoid wasting thousands of pound a year in excessive tax by not planning your remuneration package properly
🔴 We help you to figure out how to financially motivate key employees while saving the company money too


For the last 17 years, we have had the pleasure of working with and supporting hundreds of small highly profitable businesses. We’ve helped them in many ways such as:

✔️ Removing that nagging doubt, they could do better with tax planning by a root and branch review of the owner’s remuneration structure
✔️ Removing savings from high risk and litigation filled businesses to be protected and grow in a low or zero tax cost structure, ringfenced from the trading business
✔️ Using the business to provide for a significant and meaningful retirement fund, to allow  comfortable and safe retirement
✔️ Keeping key people within the business by allowing a high net remuneration structure while at the same time, minimizing the cost for the employer company
✔️ Allowing for the purchase of new companies , by carrying out cost effective due diligence, valuation reports and structuring advice
✔️ Being true tax advisors first


But don’t just take my word for it..... Have a look at what some of my current clients have to say about working with me and the team at JLA:

🗨️ “A great accountancy, with exceptionally good advice on tax and wealth management. Definitely an advisor who pays for themselves many times over.”

🗨️ “JLA has had an enormous impact on our business. We have consistently benefitted from their advice and support. I cannot recommend them enough”

🗨️ ""It didn't take long for us to see the huge difference in their knowledge, guidance and support. Clarity would highly recommend JLA to any business that wants an accountancy firm to put their clients first, they are second to none.”

You hire new staff, develop new marketing systems, perhaps get a bigger office and invest in infrastructure.

But often your financial management systems don’t develop at the same pace.

The bookkeeper that suited you when you turned over £500K may struggle to keep up-to-date. Your accounting software may be outdated, and directors can’t easily access the information they need. Cash flow might be an issue, draining your time.

The result?

-	You’re not sure the information in your financial reports is accurate – it doesn’t reflect what you know or believe is happening.

-	You may have made poor decisions, because your true financial situation wasn’t clear.

-	Worst case scenario? You’ve had a nasty surprise, like a VAT bill that was much higher than expected, because your accounts were not well managed.

I founded Insight Associates 24 years ago to help companies like yours develop the same financial processes and skills corporate companies have, so you can run more smoothly, plan effectively and generate more profit.

When you hire us as your outsourced finance department, you receive accurate, timely reporting. We put in place all the systems a grown-up company needs to manage its finances.
Most importantly as your FD/CFO, we help you interpret the numbers so they are useful to you – not just something you have to have.

After working with us, customers tell us:

- “I finally trust the numbers I’m seeing”
- “I make decisions about where to invest more confidently, because they’re based on real financial information”
- “I can spend more time developing my business, because I no longer have to fight financial fires”
- “We’re no longer exposed financially – it’s a big relief!”

If that’s those are the kind of outcomes you want to see, please email me on gmumford@insightassociates.co.uk

Never giving up is a motto of mine.

I've been told several times in my life, that what I was planning to do was impossible.  From the professional to the personal.

When I left Deloitte to set up my own Pension Audit practice, I was told it couldn't be done.  That was 2003 and I am still pinching myself that it was possible and Assure UK is alive and well.

But, I faced my own challenge with it's not possible in 2018. I was on the verge of sacking my accountant because I just couldn't get the same level of personal service that we gave our audit clients.

The problem was, this was the same as the 3 accountants before them. I almost believed that it wasn't going to be possible to find an accountant who, like our audit business, invested heavily in technology to approve efficiency whilst still giving good old-fashioned service.  Like the service our parents expect.

And that's when I had the Brainwave.  And progress became less of a twinkle in my eye and more of a real accountancy practice.  Like Assure UK, personal service is at the heart of what we do.  But, just for our own audit business we wanted the best cloud based tools, we offer these to our clients.  Because it's not just about having the technology, it's about really using it to its fullest extent.

To make sure we are giving that level of service, at Progress Accountants we work best with owners of small professional service firms and people connected with the pensions industry. After all, that's been my life since 2003.

Together we’ll focus on one of these two areas:
👍 Assure UK.  Join over 100 clients who benefit from our proven process to obtain timely pension scheme accounts and assurance reports.
👍 Progress Accountants.  Tailored support for your business.  Unlike many accountants, we are a team which can come in (or work virtually) and do bookkeeping, implementation of systems and training, right through to supporting you with your business plan.

Are you ready for the first step?

From a family of entrepreneurs with a background in estate agency and small business support, I've always fought against the norm and striven to provide innovative and great value financial services for my customers.

So here's a bit about me! Our Kent based family run estate agency business, Hellery and Lane broke the norms of conveyancing over 30 years ago by offering a fixed price service to buyers and sellers.  The conveyancing establishment didn't always welcome us, but our customers felt they were getting great value for money and a fair, fast no-nonsense service. This innovation helped to make Hellery and Lane the most successful local estate agency of it's era. After my father died in the early 80's, we eventually sold the business to Mann & Co. Ashford.

In the early 1990's I formed a small business support company, providing virtual accounting, PA, HR, Payroll and tax advice services plus rented office space, helping small businesses and start-ups begin their ventures. Through this I got to know many of the construction companies that had come to Kent to work on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL).  Their workers, some PAYE some self-employed or CIS were accumulating mileage whilst travelling to Kent and between other sites that they were not effectively claiming tax relief for.

I spotted a way I could help these workers directly, and in 1999 RIFT Tax Refunds was formed to offer a hassle free, no upfront cost service.  We now offer a tax refund service to more than 55,000 workers across Construction, Armed Forces, Oil & Gas, Security, Sports & other sectors.

The RIFT Group now employs over 160 people and has reclaimed over £135 million in tax refunds for our customers.

I left my comfort zone, broke the mould and pushed my own personal boundaries to join the dynamic company, and I have never looked back.

As Managing Director at Smart AV, I don’t just manage the finances and tick boxes, I get to do a bit of everything. I manage large sales pitches, help the team solve technical issues, streamline processes and help to grow the company in its entirety. I also get see the direct impact my decisions have.

That said, I have a great working knowledge of company formations, PAYE/VAT/Company tax, annual accounts preparation, claimable expenses, personal tax issues, Companies House returns, and regularly keep up to date with tax/accounting changes that affect contractors through publications, training courses, and a team of external tax specialists I have at my disposal.

I then gained my qualification from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in August 2013.

I have a broad spectrum of knowledge in finance and accounting, particularly with the use of Xero accounting software as well as personal and business tax. I am currently a growing Principal Advisor where I help owner managed businesses overcome the headache of business direction so they can focus on doing what they do best, all of whom have very different needs and wants.

Working with A4G, I have gained vast amounts of knowledge in order to cater for businesses in many industries and at different stages of their business cycle. I have helped those from startup business to practices who have been around since the 19th century. Been involved in various mergers, acquisitions, business sales, new partners and old, from new personnel to old but trusty systems.

The breadth of exposure I have to all shapes and sizes of client means I can offer a balanced and varied perspective on current issues and help support each business based on not just what they need but what they want as well.

After returning from maternity leave I have also accepted my newest challenge to run a whole department as Head of Bookkeeping. Within a year I have turned a previously poorly run business with huge potential and underused staff into a thriving company growing at a steady pace, tripling the turnover and now managing around 6 members of staff, with more to come.

As a result of the success and learning I have had running this business, earlier this year I also chose to set up my own social marketing business partnered with an incredible health and wellness company. I help men and women achieve some much needed work/ life balance by allowing them to create a residual income around their already busy lives. Many people I work with also go on to persue their true passions and desires through having the time and financial freedom to do so.","East Barming, England, United Kingdom",1 year 7 months in role and company,,,,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHJVX9LXVYVuw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0?e=1602720000&v=beta&t=kMm-QP6ANZ52_qOTGJ9WSOrNvhAX8XkuN7M_k5-X-YY,0,ACwAAAVpjtABm4DlT_7jStBV5UF0H31xve71ZWs,FALSE,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?companySize=C%2CD&countryCode=gb&doFetchHeroCard=false&industryExcluded=10%2C106%2C112%2C124%2C14%2C27%2C30%2C31%2C33%2C42%2C43%2C44%2C46%2C48%2C80%2C96%2C53&industryIncluded=47&logHistory=true&page=1&radius=50&rsLogId=405345881&searchSessionId=57FVoWC0TeuooOhJm66Bkw%3D%3D&titleExcluded=Partner%3A18%2CNon%2520Executive%2520Director%3A1954&titleIncluded=Founder%2CCo-Founder%3A103%2COwner%3A1%2CCo-Owner%3A195%2CSmall%2520Business%2520Owner%3A9623%2CChief%2520Executive%2520Officer%3A8%2CManaging%2520Director%3A16%2CManaging%2520Partner%3A154&titleTimeScope=CURRENT&zips=W22SZ,2020-08-14T19:59:01.326Z,,

I have been lucky enough to travel to all corners of the earth to do this and met many fascinating people along the way.  I have been able to work with some brilliant bosses and inspiring co workers and, above all team members to whom I have returned to time and again because of their proven ability to live with change and ambiguity.  What drives me is the ambition to make things better, easier and more efficient through logic and reason.  I have turned failing finance teams into best in class, implemented ERP globally, established global accounting functions from nothing, managed the tightrope of bank covenants and PE investors and bought and sold companies.

Whilst these are not the normal attributes of a Chartered Accountant I believe the training and education I received at pwc augmented by the process reengineering experience at gsk has been fundamental to my way of thinking and analysing issues and resolving problems.

Whilst many of our clients are based in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire ,Buckinghamshire and Cambridgeshire we have representation considerably further afield. Our London based clients ,for  example, find our fee structure attractive compared to London fee rates.

We are broadly based and well-resourced and offer a full range of Business Advisory and compliance services spanning accounting through to audit and assurance and taxation. We provide comprehensive business support services including bookkeeping and payroll.

We fully recognize that it is your business and it is your choice as to which firm of accountants you engage. It is very important to us to deliver a first class service so that you know that you have made the right choice in appointing us. We listen, consider and advise.

As part of our commitment to provide a breadth of service of the highest possible order we are members of Accelerate ,a community of relationship focused, technology driven, value-based accounting firms. Accelerate is a Business Associate of Crowe Global, meaning we can access accounting firms in more than 130 countries throughout the world.
We provide national and international expertise at local rates to owner managed businesses, charities and individuals.

We  draw upon both our experience of  the dynamics of SME's and our own internal experience to advise upon clashes and disputes between partners at the earliest possible stage. Unfortunately internal conflicts in business are a reality of life. Conflicts are stressful but  with proper management and advice they usually produce a stronger and revitalised business going forward. If you need help and support in this area please contact us.

If you are looking at changing your accountant, to set up in business or would just like an alternative view on your affairs please contact us to see what we can do for you or your business.

Analytical skills buzzing as I explore the best solutions whilst considering the business resources and requirements. Knowledgeable, confident and energetic, I unravel the chaos and implement financial systems and processes that support business operations.

Ask me to talk about myself and what I have to offer, and I become disordered and tangled. I struggle to sell myself as I am a doer not a talker.  However, I do not shy away from a challenge.

I find it important to promote effective bookkeeping. It could be said liberating SMEs from outdated, manual heavy processes and systems is my passion. I am constantly thinking of ways to improve processes and so, I created III Synectics to overcome the static approach to bookkeeping.

I implement and maintain strong bookkeeping systems to save time, money and sanity, because poor processes and messy records are enough to drive anyone crazy. I am confident that strong bookkeeping systems have the power to transform and improve any business.

I am experienced at transitioning clients from one accounting package to another to better facilitate their business needs for real-time information. I have trained and developed, operational staff, bookkeeping professionals and senior executives, on Xero, Sage 50, bookkeeping skills, and POS systems. I have developed and executed SOPs preventing fraud and theft.

I was excited about being part of such a global brand, finding every day a new learning experience. Great people, wonderful scope to develop skills and grow, and a exciting launch pad for my career.

After my time at KPMG I spent a brief consultancy period at Grant Thornton before being invited to join a UK AIM-listed accountancy firm, where I went on to become head of brand, PR and communications.

This was a hugely challenging role, where no two days were the same. I loved it and thoroughly enjoyed the continuous learning environment, which was exciting, sometimes daunting, but often hugely rewarding.

We work with SME business owners and we help them fall back in love with their business by helping manage the money so that they can focus on growing their company.

We help SME business owners get their in-house accounting working how it should be - helping to improve profits and optimise the cash, rather than just dealing with the paperwork.

Our proven ""YRH Best Practice methodology"" developed specifically for SME's who are growing or ""stuck"", combined with our unique team approach which enables clients to access the best accounting talent on an affordable basis, means we can easily and quickly remove the stress and headaches that business owners suffer as their business naturally needs more than family members or an unqualified bookkeeper, or the traditional accountants doing annual or quarterly accounts that don't quite seem to connect with the business day to day.

As businesses become more complex they get harder to manage at a detail level which can lead to financial challenges. We can help you overcome those challenges and by systemising and optimising the accounting activities so everything runs smoothly and efficiently, and talking you through insightful financial information and forecasts that will help you make the best informed decisions.

And all without counting a single bean..... :-)

Are you a business owner spinning lots of plates while trying to focus on growing your business? Busy Bookkeeping understands your needs, providing SME's with the financial expertise needed to achieve their business goals. As professional bookkeepers based in London we work with a variety of clients across the UK. Our aim is to become a trusted day-to-day adviser to all our clients, while often being more affordable and accessible than an accountant on those everyday tasks and queries.

•	Are you running up to date accounting software? We set up and run the latest software and provide training.

•	Do you receive regular Management Reports? We provide periodical management reporting, and we will discuss it with you to help you focus on the positives and negatives.

•	Is your business growing, but you are not ready to employ a full-time bookkeeper? We can provide a fully outsourced finance function including bookkeeping, client billing, debtor and creditor management.

We can streamline your bookkeeping and admin processes to increase efficiencies and help your business grow. Using software like Xero allows us to provide regular reports on your business, something you may not normally receive until end-of -year financials. You deserve a bookkeeper who is as passionate about your business as you are – when you succeed, we succeed.

Our services include:

•	Running of payroll through your software with associated HMRC filings;
•	VAT preparation and submission complying Making-Tax-Digital;
•	Day-to-day bookkeeping;
•	Liaising with accountants to facilitate to smooth year end processes; and
•	Use of software to streamline admin to be as paperless as possible.

If you want to take your business to the next level by spending more time focusing on your business’ growth, please get in touch by messaging me and let’s connect!

Director level experience within an owner managed SME and consulting within a university. I enjoy joining new sectors, having been successful in telecoms and education; neither of which I had prior experience.

I have audited large companies including Vodafone, Kimberley Clarke and GucciI as well as small firms including night clubs and small shipping companies. The audits included statutory audits, sarbainnes Oxley and reviews of pension schemes, law firms and state education providers.

I have also worked in the finance team of FTSE 100 companies, an SME and a University.

At Delamar Academy I created new financial models and processes. I negotiated interest rates with banks and rent in the lease extension. I managed relationships with suppliers including website design and SEO, builders, lawyer and the bookkeeper. Turnover doubled and profit trebled over a 3 year period. I also completed my original three goals; to create a new university partnership, to purchase a student house and to improve the efficiency of the course structure.

At Carphone Warehouse, and later Talktalk, I designed process reviews, performed testing and wrote new processes. Reviews included Treasury, Fixed Assets, procurement to payment and European subsidiares. I was promoted to Finance Manager where my team posted revenue down to gross profit, including migrating customer data from four billing systems to one.

I have created a company through which I help individuals or SMEs work towards achieving their potential. I have experience with sageline 50 and I am Xero accounts certified.

I am a keen runner, and occasional triathlete;  running a marathon and half ironman distance triathlon each year. I am also learning Ceroc dancing and play football and tennis through the year. I am currently training for Valencia Marathon.","London, England, United Kingdom",4 years 6 months in role and company,Finance Business Partner (Temporary contract),London Metropolitan University,https://www.linkedin.com/company/12467,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHESCS3_n5Mug/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0?e=1602720000&v=beta&t=y7S_CgyJUJw_g7eFgVtzQ43uP0cTdo-XfVmIRAVsoe8,0,ACwAAAKKrp0B2eck3KFgsqcozy1K4dk4I7eUIaE,FALSE,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?companySize=C%2CD&countryCode=gb&doFetchHeroCard=false&industryExcluded=10%2C106%2C112%2C124%2C14%2C27%2C30%2C31%2C33%2C42%2C43%2C44%2C46%2C48%2C80%2C96%2C53&industryIncluded=47&logHistory=true&page=1&radius=50&rsLogId=405345881&searchSessionId=57FVoWC0TeuooOhJm66Bkw%3D%3D&titleExcluded=Partner%3A18%2CNon%2520Executive%2520Director%3A1954&titleIncluded=Founder%2CCo-Founder%3A103%2COwner%3A1%2CCo-Owner%3A195%2CSmall%2520Business%2520Owner%3A9623%2CChief%2520Executive%2520Officer%3A8%2CManaging%2520Director%3A16%2CManaging%2520Partner%3A154&titleTimeScope=CURRENT&zips=W22SZ,2020-08-14T19:59:15.469Z,,

Not simply exam success, but an opening to the great possibilities they have within themselves. You too have great possibilities within you, and I recommend personal financial freedom as a necessary/helpful/ step on your journey to your potential.

The support and training I provide covers:-

► helping you to understand what fears and misunderstandings may be holding you back from personal financial success
► showing you how to start your side biz and your investment programme in legal, practical, ethical ways even with no money
► alerting you to why and how you need to protect your wealth and prosperity at each stage of life

Would you agree with me that it's a good idea to discover the opportunities that are around you to build your personal financial freedom?

The University requires me to deal with theory. With me though, I don't stop at the theory: I love telling the stories of the techniques I teach to get superior results for my clients and in my own businesses.

This has given me the freedom and choice of work that most people only dream about.

Would you find it useful to have me demystify the jargon around the subject?

Money management is a complex topic and I speak to many different audiences so please get in touch to discuss your needs: examples of my some recent audiences are :- managers new to budget responsibilities; students looking for employment guidance; charity trustees and charity managers.

I have a strong and diverse portfolio of clients, many of which are family-owned entities, and includes individuals through to international groups.  I enjoy working with a large number of farming families and businesses, which have very specific accounting and tax issues.

In addition to commercial enterprises, I have developed a specialism in the not for profit sector having gained extensive experience working with charities and other not for profit organisations.  These have been across a variety of charitable aims and different structures.  I understand the complexities of charities and trustee responsibilities and have provided advice regarding the many issues that affect these organisations.  I appreciate the need to demonstrate a business like approach whilst delivering the charitable aims.  I have assisted our tax team in providing advice on trading issues including vatable supplies for charities.

I enjoy meeting with clients to discuss their aspirations and accounting needs, and identifying solutions which can help these to be achieved. I work closely with our tax team to ensure that an all round service is provided.

Outside of work and my family my main interest is Guiding and I have been a leader since 1986. I hold a camp and holiday licence, which means the Guides are able to share my enjoyment of a wide range of outdoor activities. I act as a mentor for other Guiders, passing on team and leadership skills while having a lot of fun.  I am also a member the Brentwood Activities Team, which provides more adventurous activities at fun days and camps.

She now directs her substantial skills and energy to supporting young companies, high-growth start-ups and owner-managed SMEs, contributing her unique blend of strategic vision, commercial expertise and financial guidance to help them grow and prosper. She specialises in capacity planning, building up a young company’s finance function and establishing scalable controls and systems, thus freeing up management to concentrate on developing a profitable business.

Natalie’s first post-qualification role was as European Finance Manager with the UK division of a major US document management company. She brought their accounting system in-house, recruited and trained a Finance team, and set up a Shared Service Centre, controls and procedures to cope with Europe-wide business expansion. Similar roles followed at Sony UK and at SeeBeyond Technology, where she streamlined financial management and optimised business efficiency to realise substantial savings.

She was then recruited to carry out a range of projects for SABMiller plc, at the same time launching a successful riding and trekking centre in Spain. Following the sale of the business, she joined the family company, Birtley House Group, in 2007 as Head of Finance and Company Secretary, providing the business with strong financial controls and a sound basis for onward development.

In 2012, Natalie started work as a freelance portfolio consultant, bringing substantial benefits to a wide range of UK companies.

In our world, it's not about month or year end, it's making sure that every day you and your business has the cash and insight to achieve your and your investors goals.

Its probably easier to say what we don't do:
 - Statutory audits, but we will manage the process for you when the auditors visit
 - Tax, but we can introduce some amazing tax boffins to you
 - Play around with the numbers for number's sake.  We will always give you a straight answer to your question, and not shy away from any difficult conversations.

You may be wondering what we actually do? Recently, an investor bought us into one of their companies as they needed it to ""stand up on their own two feet"". This is quite an apt description of why we are used. We understand what investors need, such as worrying about breaching a covenant, which is why they regularly bring us in to their companies. On a practical level, this can mean as a part time FD, or it could be the outsourced finance dept. or even finance business partner or CEO confidante. Probably the best word or words which describe what we do are part time chief operating officer. Fighting fires, eliminating the bottlenecks, and getting our clients back to stability are what we are particularly known for.

Our clients are typically:
 - fast growth, be it an ambitious startup or a mature business starting to think about exit or a management buyout.
 - occasionally it maybe a business which is in crisis and needs some turnaround support.
 - £1m+ turnover, and paying a minimum of £1000 a month for our firms services.

Unlike many part time FD's, we are a team which can come in and do bookkeeping upwards, implementation of systems and training, right through to supporting you at your board meetings.

If your business (or the business you invest in) needs some help then call me on 0333 9398 503 or email on info@lslltd.co.uk

After sitting on the fence we’re now encouraging our clients to migrate to Xero. The reason - our experience in achieving not only major cost savings but also impressive system efficiencies. Some of our clients have five or six Xero add-ons, to their great advantage - sometimes these changes are transformational.

Our clients rely on us to remove book-keeping hassle and improve their profitability - by using our customised financial reporting based on professionally reconciled book-keeping. We also handle payroll for any number of employees.

We are very focussed and provide just two services:

1)      Book-keeping with Management Accounts on Xero or Sage
2)      Payroll with pension auto enrolment

What's unique about BookCheck is that every single set of Management Accounts we produce is both thoroughly checked and issued personally by one of our eight qualified accountants - that's guaranteed.

We never act as ‘Year End’ accountants. We complement part time Financial Directors perfectly - we produce the management information and they use it.

We use settled and proven methodology and are accredited to ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System by The British Standards Institute.

Established in 1994 BookCheck is a 60 strong professional team.

Our Clients benefit because we:

•	Remove Book-keeping & Payroll problems
•	Produce top quality Management Accounts

So that our Clients are:

•	More focused on their business
•	More profitable by using quality financials
•	Better funded by improved cash flow

We specialise in linking Xero and Sage to Excel, automatically. We call it BAR - BookCheck Advanced Reporting and it transforms the usefulness of the information. It’s totally flexible - if it's in the accounting system then we can report it in any way desired.

All our staff work naturally as a team to solve problems and create consistent top quality reporting. We have settled systems with a huge operational and professional skill base over 25 years in using Sage & Xero since it started.

•	Profit improvement from quality management information
•	Book-keeping HealthCheck from a qualified accountant

Finance is just part of the picture.

🔹 There will be things you cannot share with your team until the time is right.
🔹 You may think nobody else ‘get’s it’, leaving you feeling isolated.
🔹 There will be things you don’t know how to resolve that wake you up at night.

It doesn’t have to be this way.

My team and I will:
🔸 Understand your goals
🔸 Hold you accountable to making the changes needed for greater profits
🔸 Share tried, tested and proven advice to building a stronger business
🔸 Show you what you don’t know – training is the key
🔸 Give you peace of mind so you can sleep at night.

If this sounds like the support you need, let’s talk.

My team and I are helping business owners like you to build stronger, more profitable companies. We’d be delighted to talk about how we can help you too. We’re more than accountants, we’re business performance specialists. We’ll get you to a stronger position faster, with more confidence than if you choose to go it alone.

We do this by showing you:
1. How to interpret your businesses financials and key numbers
2. How to set budgets and targets for your business so that your personal needs are met
3. How to monitor and adapt those numbers on a monthly basis so nothing goes wrong
4. How to use your financial insights to make better, informed business decisions
5. How to use your numbers to grow your business in a structured and profitable way

I work directly with business owners and CEOs to help them understand their business performance and develop financial information, systems and people to achieve positive cash flow and profitability. My aim is to make finance simple and effective.

From working with SMEs for over 30 years, the top 5 issues for owner managers and CEOs that get in the way of achieving success are:

1.	Late year end accounts that don’t make sense
2.	Surprise cash shortfalls
3.	Not knowing which parts of the business are most/least profitable
4.	A bank that doesn’t support them, when they need it
5.	Not having someone that can explain their finances in a simple way

I’d be delighted to help you understand your barriers to growth and work with you to overcome them.

I am persistent in achieving long term goals with a resilience to overcome setbacks and push both myself and others to improve.

I have a keen interest in IT and technology, but my main work interest outside Finance is people.

I strongly believe the finance department has an extremely important role in all successful companies. Not just the accurate recording of past financial performance and compliance with legislation, but, moreover, the analytical support and variance analysis.

The ability to forecast cash flow, perform ‘what-if’ scenarios and correctly utilise cash can be the difference between having a thriving business and just surviving.

At Boost Accounting this is exactly what we specialise in.

As a proactive accountant and finance director, I partner with fast-growth, online businesses to streamline, systemise and synergise their financial data so they have access to the right financial information when they need it.

By optimising cash levels I was recently able to secure one of my clients an early payment discount with his supplier that helped his £10-million-turnover-business save £100k per year.

For another, I saved the company £60k pa and increased sales capacity by 30% by streamlining their administrative systems.

The reality is, with technology changing so fast, ecommerce businesses need a whole new kind of accountant.

Someone who is tech-savvy, able to advise on the latest trends, apps and platforms, able to think strategically and provide real-time information to aid decision-making, and act as a business advisor, technical director and financial director.

Something traditional accountants unfortunately can’t do.

If you’re an ambitious entrepreneur looking to accelerate growth, or you everything is OK with your current accounting arrangements but are curious to know what you might be missing, I invite you to give me a call.

I’ll be happy to review your business and advise on new trends that could dramatically transform your business’s performance. My advice comes with no-obligation. I simply seek to add value and give peace of mind.

At Boost, we offer a range of solutions for established businesses as well as start-ups. We’re always here to help.

I work with businesses and business owners providing tax and business consultancy, information and education.  While I am happy working across business sectors, my focus for more than 20 years has been on businesses in the property, construction, infrastructure and project finance sectors.

I focus on tax advisory rather than tax compliance services.  That includes company/ business purchases and sales, tax due diligence, business structuring, handling HMRC enquiries and general tax and business advice.  Whilst I don't produce accounts and tax returns I have good connections with businesses that provide those services.

I also provide mentoring and related services should you wish to consult me on such matters.  In particular, I work with In-House Tax Functions at Large Corporates and with owners of small businesses.

How so?

I was the Global Head of Tax at John Laing Group where I led the team on tax advisory and compliance matters.  Tax cuts across and touches almost every part of every business so I am used to working with people with a range of skills and experiences.  My tax expertise includes establishing, buying and selling businesses, international expansion, dealing with HMRC disputes and helping businesses implement tax-ready systems, processes and controls.  We grew globally over the 10 years I was with the business and in that time I led the tax function on 3 IPOs - JLIF (buyside), JLEN (sellside) and John Laing Group plc (PE to FTSE 250) and spent 3 years as a NED for a Facilities Management business giving me practical insight into being on a board of directors.

I have also been a tax advisor for KPMG (7 years), BDO (7 years) and MBS (3 years) mostly focusing on business tax and matters affecting business owners.

I love connecting people and I love squash so in 2017 I co-founded The Squash Club Business Network.  We delivered informal, relaxed business networking events with a focus on improving the fitness, health and wellness of our business communities. In 2020 we rebranded as Infinite Networking to encapsulate the potential for a broader events-based business.

Growing up in the 70s I knew I was different. When you are one of the very few non white kids at school you stand out. And being different drove me on to want to be the best.

Secondly I loved Rugby. I played as a winger in my school team. I wasn't the fastest but I could tackle! It didn't matter how big the opponent was- they went down. Two broken arms, concussion- happy days!!
Biggest disappointment however was not being awarded my school colours despite only missing a few games through injury. However this was a key lesson to me- you can only be assured of an outcome if you are in control.

Hence in 1992 at aged 28 (young in those days!) I set up my own accountancy business working from the back bedroom of my house.

Why I might be the right fit for you?

Maybe what I have said resonates with you, maybe not?

But I am a self starter. I started with stacks of ambition,  a couple of clients, a big mortgage  and within a few months a child on the way. I know all about the stresses of building your own business from scratch!!!

I have achieved a high degree of success.

In addition to a wonderful wife and family I have grown, with my business partner and team, an accountancy practice which services over 500 businesses of all sizes form the self employed to construction and engineering businesses turning over £10m.

I am a director/shareholder of a highly successful IT company and with my wife Jan have a family investment company and portfolio of rental properties. I understand that true financial wealth comes from the ability to create channels of passive income.

I have now helped hundreds of business owners to achieve their goals. Everything from setting up their businesses, raising finance, growing businesses, acquiring new businesses, employing staff, buying new business premises, diversifying, building property portfolios, de-risking businesses, saving tax and ultimately selling their businesses.

Operating primarily within the M25 area and delivering nationwide, Green Courier is a family-owned business based on decades of experience in the transport & logistics industry. We’re dedicated to finding sustainable solutions for everyday transportation problems.

I believe that we have a duty to fulfil to the environment and the world at large, and yet transportation is a simultaneously vital and carbon-intensive industry. With Green Courier, we seek to marry the two concepts together in a way that allows us to not compromise on quality whilst also drastically reducing our impact on the environment, and our partnership with the World Land Trust helps us focus our efforts to protecting what remains.

Whilst it’s fine to talk about ideals, the results are what is really important. That’s why it gives me tremendous pride to announce that every single delivery over the last 12 months has been carbon-balanced, through the use of our electric and ultra-low emission vehicles and our work with the WLT.

We have a wide range of packages & services to cater to any and all of your logistics needs. If you’d like to know more, please feel free to give me a call on 0207344445.

“Real progress has been made in improving London’s air quality in recent years and our capital’s businesses have a hugely important role to play in helping us reduce emissions even further. Green Courier, with its low and zero emission delivery vehicles, is doing exactly that and I wish them every success for the future.” – Boris Johnson, Mayor of London

Skilled in Management, Sales, First Aid, Communication, Podcasting, VAT Returns and Book keeping. I completed my GCSE’s in the Summer of 2018 from St Michael’s Catholic High School. I started my first job as a Programme Salesman and have been successful in my field since. Being extroverted, I don’t shy away from getting my voice heard for customers to purchase a programme from me. I work on Watford match days played at Vicarage Road, Watford and I am currently in the position. In late 2018, I landed myself a role as a Shift Supervisor at KFC. I worked in many roles at the restaurant such as managing and training staff, running the tills, cleaning and ensuring food was fast and safe. After a change of management at KFC, I began work at the Aldenham Country park cafè. I made coffees such as Americanos, lattes, cappuccinos and moccas. As well as making coffees, I managed and checked stock to keep business running smoothly. In search of more shifts, I began work at the Village Hotel in Elstree. When I first signed my contract I was working part time but I left 6th form in that time and switched to a full time employee. I solely ran a cafe ‘Business Club’ when on shift, ensured customers were satisfied with their service received, served for Premier League football teams, professional rugby teams and a number of A-List celebrities from the UK. Since May 2019, two close friends and I began a podcast as a hobby. Within six months, we became the most popular podcast from Hertfordshire, with little promotion, and still have growing audiences from other areas of the UK and parts of the United States. In July I began my apprenticeship at JSA Group as an accountant. I complete Quarterly VAT Returns for hundreds of contractors with Limited companies. Including book keeping, journals and client chasing. I have attended seminars about IR35 laws and it’s potential upcoming changes.","Elstree, England, United Kingdom",1 year 4 months in role and company,,,,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQF46TKGDS_jXg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0?e=1602720000&v=beta&t=prkrWpliNRPU37UFMMfLZGb0nPR1HN7yGRn4qcQTRTg,0,ACwAACPsinkBruAQGaM07QCub1MkWn8Hpv1NEuk,FALSE,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?companySize=C%2CD&countryCode=gb&doFetchHeroCard=false&industryExcluded=10%2C106%2C112%2C124%2C14%2C27%2C30%2C31%2C33%2C42%2C43%2C44%2C46%2C48%2C80%2C96%2C53&industryIncluded=47&logHistory=true&page=1&radius=50&rsLogId=405345881&searchSessionId=57FVoWC0TeuooOhJm66Bkw%3D%3D&titleExcluded=Partner%3A18%2CNon%2520Executive%2520Director%3A1954&titleIncluded=Founder%2CCo-Founder%3A103%2COwner%3A1%2CCo-Owner%3A195%2CSmall%2520Business%2520Owner%3A9623%2CChief%2520Executive%2520Officer%3A8%2CManaging%2520Director%3A16%2CManaging%2520Partner%3A154&titleTimeScope=CURRENT&zips=W22SZ,2020-08-14T19:59:50.129Z,,

“People who take the risk of starting and growing a business in London have had my complete professional focus for two decades and they are a massively varied group; but you can see the patterns in what they all need.

“If you’re expecting a flash of innovation here then stop reading; the quiet truth of 25 years experience is that business owners need four things from us more than anything else.

“The first is personal service from me or my senior colleagues - we can’t duck that or get round it by technology or reorganising our business to spread the senior people more thinly - nor should we - personal service from senior people is what business owners need.

“Secondly, they need us to create value for them - not just in the money we save but in the financial opportunities we help them take. A race to the bottom in accountancy with low fees, low expertise and low value as the goal is an absolute disaster for a business owner because it puts their rewards in jeapordy and opens up the range of risks they are exposed to. People demand value for money; but the challenge to help create value and cut risk is the thing that spurs real collaborations between us and our clients.

“Thirdly lets be very blunt: Clients need a firm with a spotless reputation, relationship and abilty to deal with HMRC. A crisis is no time to find out that your accountant lacks any of these to any degree.

“Fourth is an odd phrase that motivates me and its this:’financial therapy’.

De-stressing people and taking away pain and worry is not a gimmicky idea - far from it - it is the final and perhaps most human truth about the relationships we have with our clients and it’s what my work’s really all about.

We build our practice and client relationships on these four insights and we have some of the highest client retention rates in the industry.

I have worked on transactions for over nineteen years and have broad experience across a variety of transaction services, including bid services (take over and defence of listed corporations); stock exchange reporting accountant work; acquisition advice, synergy assessment; joint ventures; and sell side assistance, including vendor due diligence for both corporate and Private Equity clients.

I led our life sciences Deal Advisory team and have advised on a number of transactions within the pharmaceuticals sector including the sale of Actavis UK & Ireland by Teva; the acquisition of Athrocare by Smith & Nephew and Alliance Boots’ $10bn strategic alliance with Walgreens Inc.

(not my words-JW)

Dynamic business owner familiar with the need to run a business, not like a partner in a large accountancy firm telling you about your risk – when they have never had to take a risk in their lives.

I have run a successful business for many years helping the leading travel organisations and driven entrepreneurs to enjoy their business and life more.

Very proud to have been honoured by the 2020 Group,which supports hundreds of accounting firms in the UK as Managing Partner of the Year 2013.

Achievement recognised by peers as Elman Wall won National Independent Firm of the Year at the 2011 British Accountancy Awards.Also delighted that we won Independent Firm of the Year-London and National Employer of the Year at the 2013 British Accountancy Awards.

Rather bizarrely,was listed at No 21 in Accountancy Age's Financial Power List 2012,just ahead of Ed Balls and the senior partner of Deloitte!


Taking a straight talking, inspirational, highly motivated passionate approach to coach the business to be the best it can be and reach its full potential. Expert at helping people to think, applying the ‘nuggets’ from the latest thinking from the global business leaders and distilling these into a common sense approach.

My style is personable, engaging, highly experienced yet approachable and relaxed which has enabled me to build successful sustainable business relationships across the world.

Jonathan’s passions in life are Arsenal, Bruce Springsteen, his wife and four children in no particular order and his challenge is to find an hour for himself.

Welcome!

My name’s Vicky and I’m a part-time Finance Manager for Your Right Hand Finance Team.
I am highly motivated and diligent freelancer with over 5 years’ accounts and bookkeeping experience.
As well as being part of the YRH growing team I provide services to small and medium sized businesses.
We provide the highest calibre part-time accounting professionals at affordable prices.  Proactive, forward-looking, efficient and focussed Bookkeepers, Management Accountants & Financial Controllers for growing and aspirational businesses

-	Informative, focussed Management Accountants providing insightful management reporting
-	Forward-looking, proactive Financial Controllers to turn information into intelligence
-	Highly trained, accurate and efficient Bookkeepers to focus on your improving your cashflow and profit

We don’t believe you should pay for full time accounting staff if you don’t need them so we can provide any or all of the above functions so you have an entire part-time finance department, working with you at your premises.
In fact we can provide you with an entire finance department for as little as £1000 per month…
And the best bit is we have a clever way of finding an extra £1000 per month in your business, so our service wouldn’t actually cost you anything… Intrigued?  Then watch the video on our website (www.righthand.co.uk) to find out more.

The YRH service includes having your own Finance Manager who can look after:
•	Your book-keeping
•	Your payroll
•	Your credit control (generating and chasing invoices)
•	Your VAT returns
•	Setting up and managing your software and systems

I am the founder and CEO of Crisp Accountancy, an accountancy firm that works with Smart Home businesses to increase profits, master their finances and make better informed financial decisions.

Having been an accountant for more than a decade I have developed a real passion for business, constantly looking at how I can improve my own businesses and sharing these insights with my clients. I am on a mission to improve the financial understanding of business owners. My family’s business works with the smart home industry and I have grown up and worked alongside the industry. As a result of this experience I know the industry and how the businesses within it struggle with their finances. I have condensed the key areas holding businesses back from growing and achieving their potential into five main points:

1. Unknown project profitability
2. Bad admin
3. Poor resource management
4. Poor cash management
5. Cashflow/future forecasting

To solve these problems we developed the Confidence Blueprint, a proven 5 step process designed to take you from being stressed and confused about your numbers to have the confidence to make better decisions, make more money and finally be rewarded for all your hard work.

We work with clients who are tech-driven, growth-oriented and are ready to grow their business to achieve their goals.

Helping you to achieve your goals, business & personal, is my number one focus.

As your business and personal finances are closely linked, so you will want expert advice for your optimal long-term outcome. I work with you to understand exactly what you want to achieve, and then help you plan how to do it, including:
•	Maximising your investments and property return
•	Helping you grow your business
•	Considering goals for your whole family
•	Keeping your money and assets within your family unit
•	Conversion from Partnership to Limited Company status

All of my work is done on a fixed-fee basis, quoted in advance – so you always know where you stand. I will visit you at your premises, or you are welcome to come to our offices in Chesham or London

Your accounts and planning will be done by me personally: I am a Chartered Accountant, not a salesman. I also have access to specialist colleagues, if you have very particular requirements. This means that you get the best of both worlds: you get all the advantages of a personal service and affordable fees – while still having full access to large-practice specialists if you need them

I also offer specialist sector accounting, for:
•	Solicitors – including quadruple-entry bookkeeping where required
•	Medical Practices
•	Film & Entertainment Industry workers – permitted expenses, per diems, etc.
•	Independent Schools – accounts & audit

I am a Director of Littlestone Golding, an established Chartered accountancy practice based in Bucks & one in London. I am a Chartered Accountant & Registered Auditor, providing financial planning support for clients in the UK

In July 2020, I co-launched Impact Central, an accelerator whose mission is to grow a community that supports impact start-ups and let's them thrive.

Prior to this, I was a partner in Grant Thornton for over 20 years, having joined the firm back in 1983.  I held a number of senior roles both in client-facing and leadership capacities.  Most recently, I led Grant Thornton's team responsible for building and maintaining strategic and long-lasting relationships with key clients; I also led Grant Thornton’s activities in the retail sector for a number of years.

Previously, I was Managing Partner of Grant Thornton’s London Office for seven years; in that time, we grew the London business to over £300m revenue by broadening the firm’s offerings, investing in new capabilities and providing solutions to help clients grow.  In that period, I was also a member of the firm’s National Leadership Board.

I have considerable experience in corporate finance, having specialised in transaction advisory services on buy-outs, acquisitions, disposals and financial reconstructions in both public and private company situations.  I was managing partner of Grant Thornton’s Corporate Finance business for six years, when revenues grew fourfold.

My wife - Liz - and I have two teenage daughters - Milly, who is at Exeter University, and Elena, who is studying for her A levels.  As well as time in London, we live in Harpenden with a holiday apartment in Brighton. My other passions include watching football (a long standing season ticket holder at Chelsea FC), yoga (addict), running (half marathon is pretty much my limit), music (rooted in being a teenager in the 70s), reading, film, art and travel.  In August 2014 I spent two weeks with Milly doing voluntary work in Tanzania and we both returned with Elena in 2018; the trips were truly amazing experiences that I would recommend to anyone.","London, England Metropolitan Area",2 months in role and company,Partner,Grant Thornton UK LLP,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1314913,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQHatMPbvxEwfQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0?e=1602720000&v=beta&t=BppH8CHIGG07NK6on21FJfnf3STp14Vd0P3Od-ENP98,1,ACwAAAYWj1UBVqzWR9vDauMgtBcid9oemtNpkpc,FALSE,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?companySize=C%2CD&countryCode=gb&doFetchHeroCard=false&industryExcluded=10%2C106%2C112%2C124%2C14%2C27%2C30%2C31%2C33%2C42%2C43%2C44%2C46%2C48%2C80%2C96%2C53&industryIncluded=47&logHistory=true&page=1&radius=50&rsLogId=405345881&searchSessionId=57FVoWC0TeuooOhJm66Bkw%3D%3D&titleExcluded=Partner%3A18%2CNon%2520Executive%2520Director%3A1954&titleIncluded=Founder%2CCo-Founder%3A103%2COwner%3A1%2CCo-Owner%3A195%2CSmall%2520Business%2520Owner%3A9623%2CChief%2520Executive%2520Officer%3A8%2CManaging%2520Director%3A16%2CManaging%2520Partner%3A154&titleTimeScope=CURRENT&zips=W22SZ,2020-08-14T20:00:09.453Z,,

Or are you an accountant looking to provide more added value services?

•	It’s tough selling a business, the negotiations, the strain, the owners’ attachment to the business. And then there are the intrusive questions and the need to also keep the business on track.

•	Running a small accountancy firm is also challenging, dealing with numerous clients & continual deadlines. It’s tough keeping up with the day to day, let alone having the capacity for projects such as due diligence or business planning… or to think about opportunities for helping clients.

★ MY WORK splits into 3 main areas:   ★

☆	HELPING BUSINESSES THROUGH SALE with hands on support through due diligence (especially where a large firm is doing the DD!). I also carry out due diligence for people buying small businesses.
☆ OTHER ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS, including:
	> financial projections and business planning
> helping businesses develop robust and forward looking approaches to financial and risk management
> investigations into unexpected results
☆SUPPORT TO ACCOUNTANTS to help them deliver and develop these services to their larger clients.

★	MY BACKGROUND   ★

A former partner in a West End firm of accountants (now part of RSM), I was involved in its management as well as staff training & development. In 2004 I formed Camrose Consulting to help SMEs address their commercial challenges.

The clients I’ve worked with include small family-owned companies, private equity backed businesses, a charity employing 1,200 people, an acquisitive FTSE 250 consumer goods group. My industry experience includes software, care, food (manufacturing & wholesale), cosmetics and engineering, so I have diverse knowledge to draw upon.

★	DO YOU NEED ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE?   ★

Passionately curious about the updates and the novelties of the economic and business world throughout my 12 years of experience, which has led me to be a part of multiple projects in business, ICT and the tourism field.

I had the opportunity to branch out my ideas and projects in different parts of the world, including UK, Croatia, Spain, Bangladesh, Morocco and currently partnering in Saudi Arabia.

A consultative approach has been taken due to the critical role of communication to obtain alignment. I enjoy collaborating with others (either in person or virtually) to gain different perspectives to refine strategies.

I have over 20 years experience of working with and for leading technology companies. I left corporate life and set up Interim Assistance in 2002 to support entrepreneurial start up businesses as I felt that these types of companies need guidance and proactive help at a much higher level than provided by typical accountancy firms.  My experience covers all aspects of managing Finance, HR and administration in organisations from  small scale operations to International companies that need help with understanding cross border rules and implications of expansion into the UK and Europe. I have had significant exposure to the benefits and associated problems with implementing and managing employee share schemes and can offer help with compliance or assistance in setting up tax efficient schemes. Having personally worked in the Enterprise environment in addition to setting up my own business from scratch I understand the issues and challenges faced by both types of organisations in adhering to statutory compliance whilst trying to run a business.

Principal – Financial Services and Fintechteam.

I have more than 15 years experience of advising a portfolio of companies in a variety of sectors both within the UK and overseas,  principally in the role of part-time Finance Director.

Much of this work has been with entrepreneurial, owner managed businesses. I have worked with several business owners to assist them in developing and implementing their business strategy, and have helped a number of these companies to raise external funding.

Companies I have worked with have had a variety of growth strategies. These include organic growth by obtaining new customers, building recurring revenues, developing new products, and the acquisition of complementary businesses.

I have worked with a high growth Private Equity backed financial services company. This involved the preparation of the business plan, presentation to investors, development of internal systems, due diligence for acquisitions, and post acquisition integration. During my involvement, £ 38 mil equity was raised, 30 acquisitions completed and funds under management grew from zero to £ 2.7 billion.

I have previously worked for a Nasdaq owned UK subsidiary. As the company expanded, I established finance and control systems in Italy, France, Germany and Dubai.

Other engagements have involved turnaround or restructuring.

We recognise that clients now want more from their accountants than the annual accounts; they want guidance, advice and a helping hand when it is needed - be that with the production and interpretation of management accounts or with their personal financial planning. The focus should be on today and the future, not just the historic numbers.

Our directors have many years of experience of working with businesses, including running their own. We have seen many diffrerent scenarios and many different outcomes - which leaves us well placed to share our experiences with others.

About me:

I qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1987 and set the firm up in 1992 after spending 5 years working in the tax department of a national firm of accountants. I am the firm’s managing director and combined this role with the responsibility for looking after the business and tax affairs of a portfolio of clients.

My clients’ businesses range from telecoms, hospitality, healthcare and professional services to engineering, IT and retail, thereby giving me a close insight into many aspects of the local economy.

I am Chairman of the Brighton and Central Sussex Group of Chartered Accountants which represents over 1,200 local Chartered Accountants and also Treasurer of East Dean Cricket Club and Finance Director of Eastbourne RFC where I used to coach until my youngest son left to go to university.",Greater Brighton and Hove Area,28 years 2 months in role and company,,,,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFPWO75AQ_9EA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0?e=1602720000&v=beta&t=CjU2JnQhx44g7OlfKuHvL8hLSdFsmxx2KuSC8R37u-A,0,ACwAAAGzpWMBTwE5llSzRFpS881MggfTDqqHoeE,FALSE,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?companySize=C%2CD&countryCode=gb&doFetchHeroCard=false&industryExcluded=10%2C106%2C112%2C124%2C14%2C27%2C30%2C31%2C33%2C42%2C43%2C44%2C46%2C48%2C80%2C96%2C53&industryIncluded=47&logHistory=true&page=1&radius=50&rsLogId=405345881&searchSessionId=57FVoWC0TeuooOhJm66Bkw%3D%3D&titleExcluded=Partner%3A18%2CNon%2520Executive%2520Director%3A1954&titleIncluded=Founder%2CCo-Founder%3A103%2COwner%3A1%2CCo-Owner%3A195%2CSmall%2520Business%2520Owner%3A9623%2CChief%2520Executive%2520Officer%3A8%2CManaging%2520Director%3A16%2CManaging%2520Partner%3A154&titleTimeScope=CURRENT&zips=W22SZ,2020-08-14T20:00:30.339Z,,

I am a trusted sounding board at C-level across numerous diverse businesses, and have an innate ability to cut through complex layers of jargon to provide a real-world view of performance and control. I am an extremely hands-on leader across all functional areas of the business, with a track record of spotting sector and commercial gaps that offer revenue and growth opportunities.

An expert bookkeeper, I have been helping businesses manage their operational financial affairs for two decades.

Working as a trusted partner to the businesses I support, I provide an under-one-roof outsourced accounts department, with a service offering that can be flexed to suit the needs of your business. I offer a complete bookkeeping package from chasing debtors, paying creditors, payroll, vat returns to management accounts. If required, I can also prepare your annual accounts to pre-audit level, which in turn will reduce your annual accountants' bill. In addition, I have access to a broad accountancy and business management services network that can be reliably called upon should my clients affairs require this.

I work with a wide range of businesses and specialise in working with growing SMEs. My experience extends across a operations including photographic studios, printers, roofing operators, marketing communications consultancies and fashion wholesalers and many more.

On a day to day basis I work remotely from my client’s premises from my fully equipped office. I work with the following key accounting programmes Sage, Quickbooks, Xero and MYOB and am fully proficient in the Microsoft suite too.

If you are interested in finding out more about the services I provide and how we can successfully work together, I’d be delighted to discuss this with you. I can be reached on 07790295099 or by dropping me a line at  nina@ny-bookkeeping.co.uk and I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards

Nina

He then went onto train with Dearden Farrow (Now BDO) based in Fleet Street, London and qualified as an Associate Chartered Accountant in 1982.

Paul had several roles in Industry before becoming a partner in a small accountancy practice.

In 1993 Paul was invited to become a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.

In April 2004 Paul set up PWA to provide a more proactive service to the ever increasing client base and was pleased to be joined by both Sharon and Karen in this new venture.

Paul forms many new companies each year offering each practical advice and support to help them get going. Now days there are many fines for late filing of company set up forms and Paul specialises in helping people avoid these fines as well as offering set up advice on matters such as VAT, Corporation Tax and company structure and shareholding.

In recent years Paul has gained experience in company valuations, buying and selling companies and helping people achieve exit plans which are both tax efficient as well as allowing the business to continue into the future. Paul also can help if you are seeking investor finance to develop and grow your business.

Paul is company secretary for many small and large companies and has considerable skills in advising on all Company Law matters.

I try to get to know my clients well to ensure that I understand their requirements and what services they need from me and the staff at Collett Hulance.  The personal touch is extremely important to me and I believe is an asset strongly valued by my clients.

During my career I have dealt with a wide range of persons and personalities, on one occasion setting up a Company in the British Virgin Islands and in another instance, dealing with a takeover of one of my larger clients by a multi national Company, which involved learning a whole range of new skills. This whole exercise proved to be a great challenge and the ultimate successful sale of my clients business was one of the most rewarding achievements of my career to date.

I have also guided clients on a number of mergers and acquisitions over the years often mediating between the two parties to facilitate the smooth transition from business ideas to a profitable trading reality.

Following the general tightening up of investment business regulations, I gained the coveted G60 qualification in relation to pension transfer work.

I have a wide experience of personal financial planning, including wills and inheritance tax planning, also in relation to the provision of accounting and taxation advice for trusts and charities. Pulling all of this together, I see myself as a “single adviser” point of reference, including the valuation of business interests in divorce and other instances of severing business relationships.

I am a registered Trust and Estate Practitioner and a founder member of the Association of Charity Independent Examiners. I am a Director and the Company Secretary of Mercer &amp; Hole Trustees Limited, our wholly-owned Trust Corporation.


Outside of the office, my main interests are in serving Rotary and Scouting.

Our aim is both to look after our clients and to protect their interests. All this is done in a personal and friendly manner, and using language that is easily understood.

Blue Skies provides advice, not simply information.

Although shoe-horned into ""accountants"" on LinkedIn, The Blue Skies Partnership sees accountancy and tax as being a small (though very important) part of what we do.

Simply put; we work with our clients to see where they want, or need, to get to and help them get there.  One way of doing this is to use our industry knowledge to increase their income (by negotiating their contracts, assisting with networking, finding them work, career advice etc).  For some, us just being there to bounce their thoughts & ideas off is enough.

Many of my clients are in the farming sector and this has lead me to gain considerable specialist expertise in agricultural accountancy and tax.

My business philosophy is to provide a personal level of service to clients with a high level of technical excellence which as a specialst I believe I can offer.

If so then you're not alone amongst business owners who are stressed by critical cashflow problems.

I have a decade of experience with helping small business owners to become more profitable, and my team of business advisors and accountants use expertise with the key numbers to make cashflow worries a thing of the past.

Overcoming struggles to grow my businesses in the past taught me valuable lessons along the way. That’s why my focus now is to take away the stress and confusion involved in successfully growing a business and to help owners to provide their families with financial security and the life that they want to lead.

I help business owners in London and the SE, who have ltd companies with a t/o in the £150K to £6m range with 1 to 80 employees. They appreciate the value of technology and information, are looking to grow their business and are prepared to take action to do so. They fall into two main areas:

• Business owners working long hours yet still struggling to get the financial rewards:
- They often can't see how to become more profitable and take home more money, and that's where our business advisory and cashflow advisory services help.
– We help increase profits, providing owners and their families with the life that they want.

• Business owners who are stressed out and struggling with their finances and bookkeeping:
- They struggle to put aside the money they should for taxes and are in the dark with their business finances.
- By putting in place an efficient cloud system (using Xero, Receiptbank and profit analysis software) and an expert bookkeeper to free up their time and provide them with financial clarity they can pay their bills when due and sleep easily.

If you are a small business owner and are looking to grow and increase company profits to provide a better life for you and your family then please email me at pcooper@clearstonebusiness.co.uk .
